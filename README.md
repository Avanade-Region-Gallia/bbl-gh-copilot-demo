Support Repo for the Copilot BBL


## Fictional context:
We received an existing project from a client. We would like to add a new feature to it before handing it over to an Indian team. Sadly, part of the code is written in French...

## Steps:

1) Add a method "Post" to the EngineeringController with Copilot inline suggestions​
2) Add validation to Post method with Copilot comment instruction​s, such as a part name must be a least three character long and all uppercase.
3) Add unit tests for new Post method with Copilot inline suggestions​, one which passes the validation and one that doesn't.
4) Translate the method in French using contextual Copilot Chat​ to facilitate the handover (api: `parts/search`).
5) Copy the "Search" algorithm into Python using contextual Copilot Chat​ so we can reuse it our fictional Python-based ETL.

See prompts.md for reference on copilot prompts used. Feel free to experiment by yourself first!
